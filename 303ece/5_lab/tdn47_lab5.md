# Example application for Brush Motor:

Brush motors are ubiquitous. They are used for electrical propulsion, cranes, paper machines and steel rolling mills - a.k.a applications where the decrement of viable torque due to friction is not a big problem.

# Example application for Stepper Motor:

Stepper motors are nowadays widely used in applications where precise positioning with capability to hold at such position is needed, for example: floppy disk drives, flatbed scanners, computer printers, plotters, slot machines, image scanners, compact disc drives, intelligent lighting, camera lenses, CNC machines and, more recently, in 3D printers.
