<p>The problem the paper addresses is reducing pipeline's stalls due to long latency instructions (with a finite instruction buffer). The other 2 techniques which attempt to resolve the issue of the pipeline stalling is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefetching:
<ul>
<li>Solves the problem by prefetching memory that is predicted to be useful in the near future</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multithreading:
<ul>
<li>An additional thread can scan the program's instruction ahead of the main thread so that memory can be fetched prior to it being needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The paper introduces a method called <code>runahead</code>, which allows the processor to &quot;keep going&quot; in the case of a cache-miss, instead of stalling. The processor enters &quot;runahead mode&quot; when it detects an L1 cache miss. Before entering this mode, the processor:</p>
<ul>
<li>records the address that causes the miss</li>
<li>issues a fetch for the missing data in L2, L3 or main</li>
<li>check-points register file (a snapshot of the reg file before entering the mode)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 3 main key results of the paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Runahead method outperforms systems without it in most benchmarks</li>
<li>Hardware Prefetcher can be integrated with this method, and the system performance can improve/degrade depending on the performance of the Prefetcher.</li>
<li>Runahead Execution allow systems with low number of instruction windows buffer to perform well, hence, optimize the system for both performance and energy consumption.</li>
</ul>
