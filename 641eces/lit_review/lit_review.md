Summary:

This paper analyzes the 48,635 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomic sequences from GISAID consortium on their mutation in comparison to the original genome from Wuhan, China (NC_045512.2). After aligning the sequences, there are a tvifotal of 353,341 mutation events, which results in an average of 7.23 mutations per sequence, a mode of 6 mutations, and very few samples have more than 15 events. This low mutation rate means the Covid-19 viruses do not differ significantly from continent to continent; however, from countries to countries, there is telling distinctions. Looking at the mutations themselves, the authors found that most of the mutations (58.2%) are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with half of those are silent SNPs and a quarter are mutations in the intergenic regions. Deletions and insertions are relatively rare, accounting for a total of less than 1%. Among the SNPs, the most prevalent mutation (worldwide) is a transversion affecting the 23,403rd nucleotide: A>G, defining the so-called G-clade of the virus. This strand is prevalent in Europe, Oceanic, South America and Africa. The
