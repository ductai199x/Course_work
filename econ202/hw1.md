1.  Suppose that the representative basket of goods consumed in the economy in a year is made of: 150 lbs of bread, 80 bottles of water and 50 T-shirts. Prices (in USD) of each of these items,across diÂ§erent years, are reported in the following table:
<div style="margin-left: 2rem;">
<md>

Year | 1 lbs of bread | 1 bottle of water | 1 T-shirt
- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
2008 | $2 | $1.2 | $15
2009 | $2.3 | $1.2 | $18
2010 | $2.6 | $1.35 | $18
2011 | $2.8 | $1.8 | $18
2012 | $3 | $1.8 | $25

20.  Suppose that nominal GDP in 2011 is $15 million and in 2012 is $16 million, and that the CPI index is 125 in 2011 and 130 in 2012.

(a) Compute the growth rate of nominal GDP between 2011 and 2012.
> Answer:
> 
> Growth rate of nominal GDP = $\frac{16 - 15}{15} * 100 = 6.67\%$
 
(b) Compute the value of the real GDP both in 2011 and 2012.
> Answer:
> 
> Real GDP in 2011 = $\frac{15}{1.25} = \$12$ million
>
> Real GDP in 2012 = $\frac{16}{1.3} = \$13.85$ million
 
(c) Compute the growth rate of real GDP between 2011 and 2012. Is this result different from what you obtained at a.? Why? Explain.
> Answer:
> 
> Real Growth Rate GDP = $\frac{13.85 - 12}{12}*100 = 15.38\%$
>
> Real GDP in 2012 = $\frac{16}{1.3} = \$13.85$ million
> 
> This answer is different from (a) because real GDP tries to remove any effects due to inflation, or price level of one year in comparison with the previous year, while the nominal GDP does not.
