<li>The Senior Design Project this Fall is likely to be virtual due to the progress of the pandemic and its effect on the populace. Hence, I and my teammates are looking at possible ideas, which could be done almost or totally online. Some of those are: Deep Learning, and Computer Architecture. Deep Learning is a very powerful tool which can be used in many types of forcasting: weather forcasting, even disease forcasting. And Computer Architecture research can be very beneficial everywhere, especially places where large computing operations are performed (i.e data centers, cloud servers). We are still looking at the applications that all of us would like to explore and be passionate about.</li>
<li>The Faculty Senior Design Committee is my clients and the people who will do the judging of my project</li>
<li>3 considerations in forming a team are: 1) Suitable Scheduling/Commitment of team members, 2) Diverse knowledge across members, and 3) Leadership is likely necessary to drive the team</li>
<li>There are 3 types of advisors: 1) The Manager, 2) The Consultant, and 3) Research Advisor. I would like to have a research advisor since my work is related to on-going researches at Drexel and I have good relationships with professors who have researches I'm interested in</li>
<li>My Client is the Senior Design Committee</li>
<li>I acknowledged that I understand that I cannot graduate without successfully completing this course and the senior design sequence.</li>
