## Problem statement: Write a plan for yourself about how you intend to keep yourself technically current after graduation.

Technology is similar to the Big Bang. It accelerates outwards in all directions at an exponential rate. Hence, it is impossible for a person to keep track of all things current in "technology". However, it should be reasonable for someone to be up-to-date in the field of their expertise. No matter where I shall end up after graduation, whether that be industry or academia, I have to stay "updated" everyday because being obsolete means unemployment in any "tech industries". The  means to achieve such goal can be grouped under 3 main categories:
1. The Internet
2. Networking inside of the company/research center
3. Networking outside of the company/research center

The Internet is the most important way to be contemporary. Resources such as academic papers, academic media (includes videos, websites), wikipedia, google scholar, research gate, etc. are very accessible and mostly free of charge. I personally have a habit of skimming, if not fully reading at least a few sources everyday for technolgies of my interest.

In addition to my own research through The Internet, I also communicate with people around me (inside my social circle) about current technologies, especially about how the negative/positive effects these new techs can/will have on them. On the other hand, I have not done a lot of networking outside of my social circle because I have not felt a need for that at the moment, since I feel I am up-to-date with many engineering fields, especially AI and genetics processing. Again, working in this field as an engineer (or any other disciplines) in 2020 and beyond, being obsolete is almost unacceptable. Hence, I plan to keep myself "technologically current" unless, well, my own death.
