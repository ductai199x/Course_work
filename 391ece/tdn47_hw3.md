## Using the resources of Hagerty Library (NOT Google or Wiki), identify two (2) references to one or more of the topics below:    
1. Turbo codes
2. Computational fluid dynamics
3. Dancing robots    
Write the references in IEEE acceptable format 

### Turbo codes

## Look up the standard IEEE 802.11 and write a paragraph describing what this is a standard for.  

How many sections are there for the standard?  How many pages, approximately, does the standard comprise? 

IEEE 802.11 is part of the IEEE 802 set of LAN protocols, and specifies the set of media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies, including but not limited to 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, and 60 GHz frequency bands. 

The IEEE 802.11-2016 has 22 different sections, making up 3534 pages.

## Find patent #223,898 and write the first 3 claims.  

What do you think of this invention?  Will it make any money?

Patent US223898A, filed by Thomas Alva Edison. It likely made money since he sold the licence to his patent to light-bulb making companies at the time.

Claims:
1. The object of this invention is to produce electric lamps giving light by incandescence, which lamps shall have high resistance, so as to allow of the practical subdivision of the electric light.
2. the invention consists in a light-giving body of carbon wire or sheets coiled or arranged in such a manner as to offer great resistance to the passage of electric current, and at the same time present...surface from which radiation can take place.
3. The invention further consists in placing such burner of great resistance in a nearly perfect vacuum, in prevent oxidation and injury to the conductor by the atmosphere. The current is conducted into the vacuum-bulb through...wires sealed into the glass.
