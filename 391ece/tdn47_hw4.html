<p><strong>Questions to address</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>What insights did the Instagram team gain from their customers along their lifecycle?</li>
<li>How did their approach compare to what you have learned about the lean startup methodology? See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup</a></li>
<li>What substantive pivots did they make along the way?</li>
<li>Was their biggest challenge one of gaining original awareness of the product or one of growth and scaling?</li>
<li>Were they good or lucky?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answers</strong>:</p>

<li>In 2009, the iPhone from Apple Inc. started a revolution where many people can connect to thousands of other people through their little hand-held device. They were using some &quot;Check-in&quot; applications that were popular at the time to share their location information with texts or photos. The founders hopped on this trend, realizing that everyone had a little powerful camera with them. Hence, they built a prototype app, which one could take a photo with the cellphone and share that photo with the location on a public medium.</li>
<li>The main objective of LEAN is to eliminate as much waste as possible as early as possible to maximize productivity and efficiency. Their approach to the business model was similar in the way that they listened to why their customers kept using their apps in order to discover the things which worked and those which didn't as soon as possible. Hence, they pivotted from a mainly photo sharing app to a mainly photo-taking and photo-editing app.</li>
<li>Their biggest challenge was growing and scaling the app to millions of users globally.</li>
<li>They were lucky in the sense where people thought that the reason why they couldn't share photos was because of their mobile broadband networks, not because the app was running on a single server. Hence, people stuck around. However, the founders were also good at what they were doing because it did not take them long to go from prototyping to first beta and first launch. Also they were good at listening to the market, and cleverly delivering what it demanded.</li>

<p><strong>Questions to address</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a strong debate as to whether the pathway to entrepreneurial success is about intelligent design (knowing what you want to build) vs. an interactive approach (following the lean startup methodology). Where do you think AirBnB falls into that debate?</li>
<li>Were they intentional or just following their senses and experiences? Did anything change for them along the way as it pertains to this debate?</li>
<li>What were any important turning points or unique insights for the team that moved them down the path towards success?</li>
<li>Any interesting perspectives as it relates to what you learned from the Instagram podcast?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answers</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Airbnb fell into both those baskets. Success was never one thing or another. In order to go from zero-to-hero, it takes everything: both intelligent design and interactive approach, and likely a business/company model that reveals a good workplace culture.</li>
<li>They were mostly following their senses and experiences. However, after they realize what people desired and needed, they change the way the app focused on.</li>
<li>After the 1st success of airbeds-and-breakfast, the 2nd website launch got almost no attention. They realized 2 things: people did not want to exchange money in person, and people wanted to do this &quot;homestay&quot; thing not just for conferences but for vacations and other purposes as well. From these insights, they were able to build a business model: allow rentees to transfer money to hosts through their platform with a small fee; and their platform main goal were to connect people from everywhere no matter their travel purpose.</li>
<li>Being agile in changing the initial models to satisfy the demand of the market allowed both companies to succeed. Also, both companies' concepts were essentially connecting humans to humans, and that is something of great interest to the public -- this allowed their applications to get very high initial attention from users/investors.</li>
