<h1 id="read-the-presentation-by-dr-mcgrath-about-intellectual-property-copyrights-and-patents-answer-the-following-questions">Read the presentation by Dr. McGrath about intellectual property, copyrights, and patents.  Answer the following questions:</h1>
<h2 id="who-has-ownership-interests-for-intellectual-property-for-graduate-students-undergraduates">Who has ownership interests for intellectual property for graduate students?  Undergraduates?</h2>
<p>Drexel has an ownership interest in all inventions made by faculty, staff and graduate students. However, Drexel undergraduates have the right to own patents and copyrights for inventions and works (e.g. in senior design). Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>If undergrads only are inventors, each undergrad inventor has an ownership right in invention</li>
<li>If faculty, staff or grad students are also inventors, Drexel and each undergrad student has an ownership right</li>
<li>If only faculty, staff or grad students are inventors, Drexel solely owns invention</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-is-copyright-protection">How long is copyright protection?</h2>
<p>Copyright protection lasts for the life of the Author + 70 years (or a total of 95 years if a company owns it)</p>
<h2 id="how-long-is-patent-protection">How long is patent protection?</h2>
<p>Three types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant patents (last 20 years from application)</li>
<li>Design patents (last 14 years from the date of grant)</li>
<li>Utility patents (last 20 years from application)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The person or group that files first is entitled to the patent</em></p>
<h2 id="what-constitutes-prior-art">What constitutes “prior art”?</h2>
<p>ANYTHING can be prior art. Example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Papers, articles, oral presentations, something uttered publicly</li>
<li>Can be in any language</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it exists in nature, it cannot be patented</li>
<li>If it defies the laws of physics, it cannot be patented</li>
<li>If it can be documented to have been publicly available at ANY time in human history, it cannot be patented</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-are-software-patents-or-copyrights-handled">How are software patents or copyrights handled?</h2>
<p>Copyright protects the code, but not what the code can do.
And patent protects the use of algorithms to perform computing tasks (regardless of the syntax of the code).</p>
